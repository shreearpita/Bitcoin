# Blockchain Implementation in Python

## Description
This repository contains an experimental implementation of a basic blockchain system developed from scratch using Python.

## Status
Archived — this project is not actively maintained.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to understand the fundamental concepts behind blockchain technology, including block structure, hashing, and transaction flow.

## Scope
- Implemented core blockchain components such as block creation and hash generation
- Explored basic cryptocurrency transaction logic
- Focused on learning blockchain fundamentals 

## Tech Stack
- Python

## Learnings
- Understood how blocks are linked using cryptographic hash functions
- Learned how transaction data contributes to block integrity
- Gained exposure to designing simple data structures for distributed systems concepts

## Limitations
- Does not implement consensus mechanisms (e.g., Proof of Work / Proof of Stake)
- No peer-to-peer networking or distributed validation
- Not intended for real-world cryptocurrency usage

## Note
This repository is archived to keep the GitHub profile organized and transparent.
